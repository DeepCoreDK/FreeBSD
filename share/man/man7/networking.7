.Nd quickstart guide to connecting to a network
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In the following examples, it is assumed that we are connecting to Ethernet
with the first interface found by the
.Xr em 4
driver, and Wi-Fi with the first interface found by the
.Xr iwn 4
driver, though your hardware will vary.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width 0n
.It Sy Connecting to an Ethernet network with DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic # dhclient em0
.Ed
.It Sy Connecting to a cellular network with USB tethering:
.Pp
Load the USB tethering driver,
.Xr urndis 4 :
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic # kldload urndis
.Ed
.Pp
Ask for a DHCP lease on the USB tethering interface:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic # dhclient ue0
.Ed
.It Sy Connecting to a Wi-Fi network:
.Pp
Identify your Wi-Fi hardware:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic % sysctl net.wlan.devices
.Ed
.Pp
Configure your Wi-Fi hardware as wlan0 interface:
.Ed
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic # sysrc wlans_iwn0="wlan0"
.Ed
.Pp
Set that interface to negotiate a DHCP lease with
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic # sysrc ifconfig_wlan0="WPA SYNCDHCP"
.Ed
.Pp
Enter the details of the Wi-Fi network:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic # wpa_passphrase "myssid" "mypassphrase" >> wpa_supplicant.conf
.Ed
.Pp
Restart the network interface daemon:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic # service netif restart
.Ed
.Pp
.It Sy Scanning for Wi-Fi networks:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic % ifconfig wlan0 scan
.Ed
.It Sy Airplane mode:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Ic # service netif stop
.Ed
.El

.Xr dhclient 8 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,

.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
.Pp
The Advanced Networking chapter of the
.Fx
Handbook.
.Sh CAVEATS
Shell Special Characters in the
.Ar SSID
or
.Ar passphrase
will need to be escaped for
.Xr wpa_passphrase 8 ,
commonly using
.Ql \e ,
see the manual page for your shell for more details.
.Pp
Currently
.Ql Ic service netif restart
does not restart routing.
A common workaround is to issue
.Ql Ic service netif restart && service routing restart
instead.
