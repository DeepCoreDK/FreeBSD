Configure your Wi-Fi hardware as wlan0 interface:
.Dl # sysrc wlans_iwn0="wlan0"
Set that interface to negotiate a dhcp lease with wpa supplicant:
.Dl # sysrc ifconfig_wlan0="WPA SYNCDHCP"
Enter the details of the Wi-Fi network:
.Dl # echo "network={ssid="myssid" psk="mypsk"} >> wpa_supplicant.conf
